# Cabin Passenger
# Made by Chetan Tyagi.

# Introduction
This application, named Cabin Passenger aims to solve the problem of the inability to imagine the past. Cabin Passenger uses the recently released DALL-E API, along with a user-friendly text-based program for the best results. The app will obtain inputs of a country and a specific year to provide how life was in the era. This can provide a whole new perspective on how people see history. 

# Inspiration
History inspires me, and I always brainstormed what Ancient Egypt must have looked like in high school. Now with this application, everyone can do so in any country.

# How it Works
The program has three main commands, ride(for running the program), exit(for stopping the program), and help(to get instructions) with their distinct roles. When the program is run, it asks for the input of a country and year from the user. In case the user types an incorrect name for the country, the program suggests a list of countries (a list of randomly generated 4 countries) based on the first letter of the input or the second letter if applicable. Similarly, the program suggests the user with suggestions if the input is incorrectly given. After obtaining the required inputs, the prompt is generated, which gets sent to DALL-E API for image creation. Once the image is created, the program suggests ways the user could get the image.

# How I built it
Upon DALL-E API getting released recently, I realized that this is the best opportunity to create what I longed to create for a long time. I used DALL-E API, my knowledge of Operating Systems, and Python to bring the idea to life.

# Challenges I ran into
Even when DALL-E is one of the best engines in its field, it can still have some irregularities in its results. I tweaked the dates in such a way that the given results are as accurate as possible, which took a lot of time and effort.

# What I learned
I learned concepts about Operating Systems that I was previously unaware of and now unlocked the potential to create much better applications than I could before.

# What's next for Cabin Passenger
The application will get a GUI soon, and also gain more features to make the experience much better for the user.
